props are immutable: they are passed from the parent and are “owned” by the parent. To implement interactions, we introduce mutable state to the component. this.state is private to the component and can be changed by calling this.setState(). When the state updates, the component re-renders itself. [https://linkedlist.org/react](https://linkedlist.org/react)
