Today I started working from home for the first time ever and had a Sudden Clarity Clarence realisation that most of my work is just me sitting in front of a screen sending text and commands to other machines over an interconnected network of other machines.

I was listening to Bill Burr's Thursday Afternoon just before Friday Monday Morning podcast where he dropped the truest words said so far about this whole coronavirus situation:

> That's the leak in the balloon right there. It's how dumb the average fuckin person is... Self quarantine is not gonna work. Please are too fuckin stupid... they are too fuckin selfish to even fuckin understand.

It sounds harsh, but just today I was arguing with someone because they want to have their kids travel across country on public transport so that they can be with them, because they miss them. Fair enough, I get that. If it were any other time this would have been perfectly fine. But the fact of the matter is that these aren't normal times are they. I asked somewhat rhetorically if they didn't care that the kids might catch the virus in public transport because we don't know who's infected and who isn't. Some people are asymptomatic for crying out loud! Was this a risk they are willing to take? "Nah, I doubt they'll catch it", was the retort. That right there is stupidity. Then there's lack of consideration that if they do get infected, they will likely pass it on to other people who may be more susceptible to its effects. Who cares, so long as I see my kids right? That there is the selfishness.

Until we have this thing under control the most pragmatic, responsible, non-reckless thing we all can do is minimise our movements, and practise the precautions that the WHO has put out there. Unfortunately, I think it's all going to be for nought because people are just selfish and too stupid. I mean, just look at all the videos making the rounds on social media of young people dancing in clubs or swimming in pools while chanting, "There is no corona here!" 🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️
