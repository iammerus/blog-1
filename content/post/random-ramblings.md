## 18 September 2020

Been a while since I wrote anything on here... and so much has happened in between. The coronavirus is still raging hard in the Western world, Africa mostly shrugged it off (_knock on wood_) and a lot of countries are now reopening, I have started playing and getting comfortable with AWS at the urging of my homie Marengz and one Meru-kun (_tall ugly fella of note_), I'm still cycling, this week I became a victim of a card cloning attack (_fuckers robbed me blind_) and jury's still out on whether the bank will reimburse those funds, ZANU is still a cancer obviously, Chadwick Boseman passed away, Zoom meetings are still going strong, I'm still working from home, [NVIDIA launched their 3000 series of cards today and they got sold out in seconds leaving a bunch of day-oners sad](https://web.archive.org/web/20200917200027/https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/17/21443901/nvidia-rtx-3080-ebay-reselling-sold-out-shortages), etc etc. Same old shit dawg, it's a different day.

Anyways, the actual reason I started writing is because I wanted to say this is the best, most rivetting trailer I have ever watched in my life. I can't stop watching it. It's that good. I AM... A REVOLUTIONAAARY!!! I AAAAM... A REVOLUTIONAAARY!!! DANIEL KALUUYA IS AMAZING MAN.

I'MMA DIE FOR THE PEOPLE COZ I LIVE THE PEOPLE!! I LIVE FOR THE PEOPLE COZ I LOVE THE PEOPLE!!

Can. not. wait.

It's exactly 4 weeks today since I installed Ubuntu as my main OS and I think, finally, after years of toying back and forth with a move, I'm here to stay. Ubuntu 20.04 feels so polished and easy to use, it's just a great experience. I guess it also helps that I've gotten much more comfortable using the commandline over the years. Windows 10 has just been awfully frutstrating of late and a new LTS version of Ubuntu coming out when it did was just the excuse I needed to make the move. Whilst I still have to use Windows for work it's adios to shitty, inconsistent UIs and awful, terrible, no good search on my personal machine at least. An added bonus is that a lot of software I enjoy tinkering with (_that is primarily suited to *nix environments_) now just works without nasty hacks or workarounds... To be fair to Microsoft though, WSL had improved things a whole lot on that front but I figured if the reason I'm ennjoying working in Windows more and more is WSL I may as well move to the full experience. I did, and I was not disappointed for it.

[Hamilton is coming to Disney+ a year early!!](https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/05/hamilton-is-coming-to-disney-a-year-early-just-in-time-for-fourth-of-july/) Super excited for this. I've only been waiting since 2015 when the original show got released. Obviously couldn't watch it then (_and for the next 5 years_) because the tickets were going for $1500+ a pop and it was only screening in the States. I remember listening to the first track of the Hamilton OST and getting instantly hooked. The story telling was so vivid, I had that one track on repeat for 30 minutes straight. I even remember where I was üòÇ.

Oh man.. this is going to be good.

I just stumbled upon a new [MADE IN ZWE](https://madeinzwe.com/) song while scrolling through YouTube at 2 in the morning. Insomnia is a canine with two X chromosomes. Either way, I'm glad I found this song - it's been on repeat for the past ~~20 minutes~~ hour and a half now.

I'm really liking this, much like the rest of the content this collective has been putting out. The start of the song reminds of a Hamilton OST joint, I just can't put my finger on it right now.

Rap verses are solid, both X-O and Munashe's deliveries are impeccable. Haha a shout out to Mzilikazi and Bulawayo, nice. It's so refreshing to hear English, Ndebele, and Shona being spit interchangeably and yet so eloquently. I'm all here for it man! The penmanship is fire son! Fire! If anything, I would have liked for Michael Chiunda to have also featured. Dude's nice on the mic. No lie.

Unfortunately, I can't recognise the rest of the voices of the artists on here but it's safe to say that everyone went in!! The spoken word interludes were also really well done. Found the credits, those parts are by RUE.

These lyrics have a lot of thoughts racing through my mind... The song is a reminiscence of what we were, a contemplation of what could have been, a cry for what we have lost, a celebration of being Zimbabwean, and ultimately a call to action to us the so called "born-frees" (_although I think we were just born into a different era of tyranny than the one our parents and grandparents lived through_). It's equal parts nostalgic and hopeful.

I love it, I really do, but I personally find it hard to be hopeful about a country that fights you at every turn. L's are all we know. Most of us anyways.

OK, I need to try and sleep. Work will be miserable today. üò©

The Spotify algorithm is on point today. It just recommended me some old school Fiddy album/mixtape that I honestly have never heard before. And maaaaan, it's that old 50 threatening to smack dudes and nicely disposess them of their jewellery. Bars delivered with such a smooove, effortless flow. I really like this. It's that hunger, 50 was rapping like his life depended on it... probably because it did. Mans needed that deal.

> 1999's the year of the predator, I'm killin' to eat \
> niggas'll treat you like a egg, you come to cop you get beat \
> gimme your dough, oh, you wore your jewels? what a treat \
> you're a generous guy \
> take 'em off or die \
> man, we hurtin' 'round here, ain't nobody slingin' pies \
> look around, ain't nobody 'round here fly \
> why you 'round here with this shit anyway? huh? you high? \
> see, you done made the wrong move, kiss your ass goodbye.

üòÅ 50 was a fool, still is actually

Honestly, how is Microsoft this bad at search in their own apps? Don't they own a whole search engine... Look at these screenshots here. The start menu News app tile is showing a headline I find interesting, so I open the app and search for the exact headline text but, surprise surprise, it finds nothing. How? It's literally the same app that's updating that tile. TF.

I have the "This is Rick Ross" essentials playlist as compiled and recommended by Spotify on my home tab. Listening to "Hustlin'" I must say, that beat drop and how Rozay starts his verse is still one of the most fire intros ever.

For his debut single, Mr. Ross could not have done better, I don't think. This is how I personally got introduced to that brash, braggadocious, and loud attitude we've to expect from El Jefe.

Github seems to be having a bad time at the moment... access is slow AF - if it loads at all, that is.

Actually, with the way these MNOs keep pushing their social media data bundles down people's throats, maybe someone should make a WhatsApp bot to subscribe to podcasts where it sends you new episodes as compressed audio as they are released. I mean podcasts are really just RSS feeds... shouldn't be that hard right?

I just clandestinely introduced my father to podcasts by downloading an episode and sending it to him via WhatsApp. It was an episode of The Daily, an interview with Dr. Fauci. I had spent part of the evening trying to debunk some fake news and conspiracy theories that he'd forwaded to me about Africans being used as guinea pigs for vaccines, and 5G causing coronavirus. I think he was having a time believing what I was saying so I figured the podcast might save me the trouble üòÅ

This week's [This American's Life episode](https://www.thisamericanlife.org/698/the-test) is a hard listen. It's terribly heartbreaking. We get to hear first hand accounts from people who have been directly affected by this virus in some pretty devastating ways... There's the story of a husband who had to leave his wife at home while she was sick because he was in essential services only to find her dead when he got back. There's a man completely breaking down on the phone to his brother while discussing him and his wife's sickness and the ever-so-real possibility of them both dying and leaving their daughter behind. And to think some still think that it's not so bad because, well, the fatality rate is not that high. Humans sometimes exhaust me.

If there's any silver lining (_there isn't really_) to this pandemic, its that this year we have been spared the godawful April Fool's Day jokes and pranks from tech companies and news publications who think themselves funny.

Looks like we are finally going into lockdown for 21 days starting on Monday. Hoping it's not a case of too little, too late. We thank the president Cyril Ramaphosa for the leadership. Cde. Xerox had to wait a couple of days before announcing so that it wouldn't seem too obvious. Personally, I think he nailed it. Good job, sir. Good job.

![A bicycle. My one.](/images/IMG_20190419_101426.jpg)

Today, during my lunch break and after work, I went cycling again. Hadn't realised how long it had been since I last did. I should try and make more time for it.

Judging by the past few weeks' headlines it appears that everything we are doing collectively right now, is the biggest, largest, hugest experiment of that _thing_ ever done. Remote working? [Check](https://web.archive.org/web/20200319165645/https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-02-02/coronavirus-forces-world-s-largest-work-from-home-experiment). Online learning? [Check](https://web.archive.org/web/20200325185551/https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-biggest-experiment-in-online-learning-ever/id1479107698?i=1000469119440). And to top it all off, I have newsletter spam about WFH from every other company/website out there: Trello, Heroku, Dev.to, and so on. To be clear, I'm not complaining. I most likely subscribed to all these outlets myself, and there's probably some reasonable advice on the topic in there. I just had to chuckle when I realised that I'd come across these headlines one too many times to the point where it was starting to feel like the Matrix was being glitchy. Look at this:

Listening to the small kids on either side of my yard shouting to each over the fences, "MY MOM SAID I CAN'T COME THERE, WE'LL PLAY ANOTHER TIME!" is quite heart-warming, and a little sad. But it's reassuring that other parents are treating this with the seriousness it deserves.

## 24 March 2020

Today I started working from home for the first time ever and had a Sudden Clarity Clarence realisation that most of my work is just me sitting in front of a screen sending text and commands to other machines over an interconnected network of other machines.

Yesterday, Zimbabwe recorded its first death from this COVID-19 pandemic. The details surrounding the young man's death that came to light [today](https://web.archive.org/web/20200324195057/https://dailynews.co.zw/makamba-family-fumes-over-zororos-death/) are horrific to say the least. Horrific but unsurprising, sadly. Our public health infrastructure has been in shambles for years now. The government is woefully unprepared to deal with the few cases that have been confirmed, let alone a full-on outbreak. While we may be on the verge of a serious unmitigated disaster, there's still a reluctance to act and take decisive action by the government. A leadership vacuum it's been called by some. Sigh... We are quite literally on our own.

I was listening to Bill Burr's Thursday Afternoon just before Friday Monday Morning podcast where he dropped the truest words said so far about this whole coronavirus situation:

> That's the leak in the balloon right there. It's how dumb the average fuckin person is... Self quarantine is not gonna work. Please are too fuckin stupid... they are too fuckin selfish to even fuckin understand.

It sounds harsh, but just today I was arguing with someone because they want to have their kids travel across country on public transport so that they can be with them, because they miss them. Fair enough, I get that. If it were any other time this would have been perfectly fine. But the fact of the matter is that these aren't normal times are they. I asked somewhat rhetorically if they didn't care that the kids might catch the virus in public transport because we don't know who's infected and who isn't. Some people are asymptomatic for crying out loud! Was this a risk they are willing to take? "Nah, I doubt they'll catch it", was the retort. That right there is stupidity. Then there's lack of consideration that if they do get infected, they will likely pass it on to other people who may be more susceptible to its effects. Who cares, so long as I see my kids right? That there is the selfishness.

Until we have this thing under control the most pragmatic, responsible, non-reckless thing we all can do is minimise our movements, and practise the precautions that the WHO has put out there. Unfortunately, I think it's all going to be for nought because people are just selfish and too stupid. I mean, just look at all the videos making the rounds on social media of young people dancing in clubs or swimming in pools while chanting, "There is no corona here!" ü§¶üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§¶üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§¶üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
