Sometime in 2018, October I think, I deleted my Twitter account. I'd been toying with the idea for a while but hadn't gotten around to actually doing it. The two main reasons for my desire to leave lay in the facts that I was spending too much time on it, and that there was an unending stream of vitriol and nastiness constantly finding its way onto my timeline -- it _was_ soon after the [disputed election](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018_Zimbabwean_general_election) afterall. Anyway, at the urging of a colleague I finally deactivated it and waited for the 30 day "you can still change you mind" window to lapse before it was permanently deleted.

Sheesh, what a long-winded intro... What I was getting at is that since I'd also relied on Twitter to follow tech blogs and news publications for the purposes of staying current on those fronts, I suddenly found myself with the problem of how to get content from those sources without manually visiting each site everyday. RSS of course was the obvious solution here. It's an open standard that is almost ubiquitous. What's not to love.

At this point I could have simply signed up for a Feedly account and called it a day. But I remember Google Reader... I used Google Reader and they killed it. I sure as hell wasn't getting suckered into signing up for another third party service that might disappear tomorrow. Also, where was the fun in that! I clearly needed to build my own RSS client. So I made [rssdeck](https://rssdeck.wews.co).
