I like **well designed** software. I also like **free** things, as I'm sure do you. Every now and again these two qualities/properties/attributes intersect and I'll stumble upon a free, cool piece of software that I reckon may be useful to me (or you) in the future. While there's a 90% chance that I won't ever use most of these, here's a running list of said applications/systems/software nonetheless:
