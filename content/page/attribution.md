## Design

This site's design is based on that of Jessie Frazelle's personal blog [https://blog.jessfraz.com/](https://blog.jessfraz.com/). I made it into a theme called **hugo-jessie** that you can find here: [https://github.com/spaghettiwews/hugo-jessie](https://github.com/spaghettiwews/hugo-jessie)

## Fonts

The theme uses the IBM Plex font [https://www.ibm.com/plex/](https://www.ibm.com/plex/), specifically these two variants:
